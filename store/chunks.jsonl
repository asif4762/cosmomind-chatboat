INTRODUCTION\nTerra is a joint project between the United States, Japan, and Canada. It was launched on December 18, 1999 from\nVandenberg Air Force Base aboard an International Launch Services Atlas booster  into a Sun-synchronous orbit around\nthe Earth [1].  It joined the Landsat -7 satellite (launched in April 1999)  and the Landsat -5 satellite (launched in March\n1984), both of which are operated by the United States Geological Survey (USGS).  A year later, Argentina’s SAC -C\nsatellite and NASA’s technology demonstration satellite, EO-1, were launched into the same orbit, thus forming the Earth\nobserving Morning Constellation.\nThe Terra mission marked the beginning of the comprehensive study of clouds, water vapor, small particles in the\n"}

CHALLENGES\n4.1 Conjunction Assessment – a New Paradigm\nIn the early years of the Terra mission , the Flight Operations Team (FOT)  focused on maintaining the spacecraft Health\n& Safety, maintaining orbit , performing calibration activities , and ensuring the science data downlink.  Since then,\nconjunction assessment has become a new high priority in order to protect Terra and other satellites, and to preserve\npopular orbits from additional debris. The conjunction assessment process evaluates not only the conjunction of two\nobjects, but also the post-maneuver conjunctions to p rovide insight on the safety of a planned maneuver.  Terra became\nthe first satellite in the 705 km International Constellation to perform a Risk Mitigation Maneuver (RMM) on October 21,\n2005.\nThis evolving threat was exacerbated by the Chinese anti -satellite missile test with Fengyun 1C on January 11, 2007 and\n"}

As of July 2014, Terra has conducted 12 RMMs which\nincluded either (a) performing a maneuver to mitigate a conjunction or (b) waiving off a planned maneuver to prevent a\npost maneuver conjunction. Another 12 conjunctions required RMM planning but were waived off because the risk of a\nconjunction was reduced to an acceptable level prior to maneuver execution.\n4.2 Micro Meteor Orbital Debris (MMOD)\nMicro Meteor Orbital Debris (MMOD) is a concern.  It is believed to be the most likely cause of the BBAT cell failure (1\nof 54) and the loss of heater control for half of the BBAT (PBAT remains unaffected).\nTo compensate for the lost heater control, BBAT has been configured to perform slight overcharge to maintain cell\ntemperatures above freezing (Fig. 5).  Recently, the FOT used the BPC to shift additional load to the BBAT and less load\nto the PBAT.  This increased BBAT discharge every orbit has increased the BBAT cold cells by approximately 2 degrees\n"}

After consultation with the spacecraft manufacturer, Goddard Space Flight Center ( GSFC)\nbattery experts and Flight Software Sustaining Engineering, changes were made to the battery management software  to\nallow for the batteries to be operated independently.  Disabling the PBAT BPC channel increased the BBAT discharge by\n14%.\n4.3 Lack of Bit Synch in Fill Data Blocks\nFor an unknown reason, bit synch was not added when Terra fill data blocks were originally designed.   This requires Terra\nto transmit live science data on each and every support in order for the White Sands ground station to lock onto the data\n(since live  science data blocks contain bit synch).  However, the ground station does not lock onto the data stream\nimmediately, so this initial data must be replayed later."}

If the  motor current\nis too high (ab ove 1250 mA) or too low (less than 475 mA), the Antenna Control (ACON) automatically turns off the\nMDA and sets a bit to indicate an MDABITE failure.   However, the High Gain Antenna (HGA) MDA  opto-couplers are\nsusceptible to single event upsets, induced by  high energy protons usually over the South Atlantic Anomaly or the poles,\nwhich cause the protection to trip erroneously.  When the MDA is turned off , the HGA loses proper pointing control and\nwill begin off-pointing from the intended TDRS.

If a second MDA2BITE failure occurs without the FOT\nexecuting the anomaly clean up, the TMON will recover the MDA after a 7 minute wait, and after a 30 minute wait for a\nthird MDA2BITE failure.

It was\nfound that for dense vegetation the value of NDVI ≥ 0.7 and for\nthe sparse vegetation its values range from 0.3 to 0.5.

For the MOD-\nAPS in its current configuration, these factors include the\nfollowing.\nAvailability of all inputs: Some of the Level 2 processing\nrecipes require a set of granules to start. Any delay in\nreceiving some granules will lead to delaying the production\nof other granules, which will subsequently delay the pro-\nduction of all daily products.\nUse of ‘update’ files: Some science algorithms use\nintermediate ‘update’ files to collect data for use in the final\nproducts.

However, widespread use of the products only\noccurred after the data sets had undergone several sets of\nreprocessing over a decade. For the AVHRR, there were\nseveral distinct stages of initial production, internal and\nexternal evaluation, identification of problems, improve-\nments and subsequent reprocessing and research is still\nbeing undertaken to improve the A VHRR processing which\nstarted in 1984(El Saleous et al., 2000; Townshend, 1994).\nIn the initial stages of MODIS product generation, these\nstages have been highly compressed and are taking place in\nparallel.

Introduction\nThis document describes the theoretical basis of MODIS Atmosphere Level 3 (L3)\nproducts.  Topics covered include computational approaches and scenarios, subsampling and\ngridding characteristics and caveats, the impact of Level 2 (L2) confidence flags  on L3, and\nfinally a breakdown of the parameters and statistics computed in L3.\nThe “Level” terminology is u sed to denote broad categories of MODIS data products:\nLevel 0 (L0) denotes raw spectral channel counts, Level 1B (L1B) denotes calibrated and\ngeolocated radiances, Level 2 (L2) denotes orbital -swath science products, and finally Level\n3 (L3) denotes global-gridded science products.\nAll L3 MODIS Atmosphere products, retrieved from MODIS instrument and ancillary\ndata, are grouped into user -friendly Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) files based upon the\nplatform (Terra or Aqua) and temporal period of collection  (Daily (08_D3), Eight Day\n(08_E3), and Monthly (08_M3)).\nTerra data use a MOD prefix in the HDF  file name.  Aqua data use  a MYD prefix.  So,\nfor example, a Terra L3 Daily file would have an H DF filename prefix of MOD08_D3 and\nan Aqua L3 Daily file would have an HDF filename prefix of MYD08_D3.\nThe Terra overpass time at the equator is around 1030 local solar time in its descending\n"}

Dropped pixels in L2 products\nOne additional characteristic should be noted here.  A MODIS scan is 1354 1 -km pixels\nin width.  For 5 and 10 km resolution L2 products, the last 4 pixels in each MODIS scan are\neffectively dropped when performing retrievals (a pre-launch decision made by the L2 devel-\nopment teams).  For example, for 5 km cloud top property parameters, no retrieval is made\nfor the last 4 (hanging) pixels in each scan line.  This also impacts the geolocation (latitude\nand longitude) arrays where there is not geolocation compu ted or stored for the last 4 pixels.\nTo make this clearer, even though there are 1354 1 -km pixels in a scanline, there are only\n270 5 -km cross-scan geolocation grid points and data retrievals in 5 -km L2 products (and\n135 geolocation grid points and data retrievals in 10-km L2 products).  Therefore, in all 5-km\nand 10 -km L2 products (and L3 products derived from those L2 products), a very tiny\namount of potential data at the far edge of each MODIS swath is not used, however due to\nthe 1° × 1° averaging in L 3, this is more of an issue in 5 -km and 10-km L2 products than in\n"}

Since 4 unique retrieval algorithms are offered. The answer is\nthey all have various strengths and  weaknesses.   When Gala Wind, the Cloud\nOptical Properties researcher and programer, was asked that question, she noted\nthat “it depended on which instrument you might want to compare it to” –\nmeaning that if you were looking for differences between MODIS and another\ninstrument.  You should probably choose the MODIS retrieval that most closely\nmatched the bands being used to retrieve Cloud Optical Properties in that other\ninstument.\nAll things being equal, we generally suggest that MODIS data users at least\nstart out with the Primary 2.1 micron retrieval.\nFigure 8.14 shows a comparison of Liquid Water Cloud Optical Thickness\nfor a particular day using each of the four available retrievals.

In situ and satellite data cross-comparison considerations\nThere are significant differences between in situ\nmeasurements and satellite instrument (e.g. MODIS) retrievals.\nFirstly, the top -of-atmosphere measurements from satellite\ninstruments are affected by both the atmosphere and cloud\nconditions - even for those bands designed for Earth surface BT\nretrievals. Secondly, satellite instruments measure spectral\nradiance, and then convert to BT for th e corresponding band\nwavelength spectra. Hence, the scene emissivity is spectrally -\ndependent, and makes the in situ SST and satellite instrument\nBTs different. Lastly, scene uniformity, seasonal variation, and\ntime difference between measurements have effe cts on the\nsatellite instrument retrievals. On the other hand, in situ\nmeasurements have distinctive advantages such as: precise and\naccurate instrument calibration and SI traceability.

SUMMARY\nThe Terra and Aqua MODIS sensors have been - and\ncontinue to be - cornerstones for the global monitoring of\nnumerous Earth geophysical changes. While both instruments\ncontinue to provide reliable daily scientific measurements well\npast their designed lifet imes, it is crucial to monitor them for\nany long-term changes. In this study, an ocean surface site was\nused as reference to perform calibration, consistency, and RVS\nstability assessments on all the MODIS TEBs.  Analyses were\nperformed in which the MODIS data were normalized to the in\nsitu SSTs using an empirical model. Additionally, the Terra and\nAqua MODIS TEBs were evaluated for consistency , and a\nSBAF correction was applied to all Terra/Aqua MODIS band\npairs with significant spectral differenc es. The SBAF values\nwere derived using simulated radiances (obtained from\nMODTRAN) and the Terra and Aqua MODIS RSRs.\nMost Terra and Aqua MODIS TEBs show mission -long\nstable trends. Terra band 30 shows the largest downward trend,\nwhile Aqua band 30 also displays a descending drift, albeit with\na much lower change rate. This is consistent when using both\n"}

Terra band 30 shows the largest downward trend,\nwhile Aqua band 30 also displays a descending drift, albeit with\na much lower change rate. This is consistent when using both\nband 31 and the in situ target as references. Terra MODIS band\n30 undergoes larger electronic cross -talk effects when\ncompared to the other PV LWIR bands. To this effect, c ross-\ntalk correction coefficients are derived from lunar observations,\nand the correction is applied to the BB calibration and Earth\nradiance retrievals  in C6.1 . However, cross -talk residuals\nremain. The bands with the largest CO2 absorption effects also\ndisplay consistent downward drifts and change rates  over the\nocean site for both Terra and Aqua MODIS. Bands 27 and 30\ndisplay the largest Terra -to-Aqua biases and trends  after the\nSBAF correction, while bands 24 and 25 were significantly\ncorrected after the spectral correction. The MODIS TEBs RVSs\non-orbit performance was assessed for both MODIS\ninstruments. Terra and Aqua MODIS bands 25 and 27 exhibit\nthe largest RVS drifts consistently for the edge -of-scan angles.\nOverall, the MODIS TEBs are stable and consistent  (between\ninstruments); with close to no change to their RVSs."}

The\nhistograms for AOD distribution were examined in the study\nregions to assure that the amount of data removed using AOT\nthreshold is minor and is not expected to introduce any spa-\ntial and temporal biases in data analysis (see Supplementary\nmaterial Fig. S1:http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/9/3461/\n2009/acp-9-3461-2009-supplement.pdf).

This reduces the probability for\nboth cloud contamination and contribution of highly humid-\niﬁed aerosols (Koren et al., 2005). Finally, we have carried\nout comparison of MODIS AOD with AERONET (Holben\net al., 1998) observations in the vicinity of selected stratocu-\nmulus regions (at San Nicolas Island off the coast of Califor-\nnia and Ascension Island in South Atlantic) (see Supplemen-\ntary material Fig. S2:http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/9/\n3461/2009/acp-9-3461-2009-supplement.pdf) to show, that\nthere were no signiﬁcant differences for episodes with higher\nAOD.\nFor a study in which multiple satellite sensors are em-\nployed it is crucial to correctly estimate cross-platform agree-\nment and accuracy.

Concomitant informa-\ntion about the aerosol loadings and cloud properties available\nfrom the MODIS sensors offers an unprecedented opportu-\nnity for exploring morning-to-afternoon variability of cloud\nproperties and we expect that the technique proposed here\nwill be used in the future for improved understanding of in-\ndirect and semi-direct effects of aerosols on clouds.\nAcknowledgements.Meskhidze would like to acknowledge the\nsupport from National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n(NASA) Goddard Visiting Fellowship.

Introduction\nLandslides are one of the widest spread types of geohazard all around the world\nand are mostly caused by preparatory triggering factors such as earthquakes [1], human\nactivities [2] and extreme rain episodes [ 3]. Such gravitational mass movements occur\nnearly everywhere in Austria; in fact, in 2014, it accounted for 306 events (67 rockfalls\nand 239 landslides) which left ﬁve deaths and 10 injured people together with extensive\ndamage to public and private properties. In the context of disaster management, a rapid and\nrepresentative overview of the areas hit by hazardous events [4] must integrate surﬁcial\nmapping, which enables a detailed classiﬁcation and delimitation of the phenomena,\nwith aerospace-borne image analysis [5,6] with its ability to provide regional scale landslide\ndetection and accessibility to remote areas [7].

Although those early works established\na series of standard methods for mass movements’ detection [11], the limitations of the\nminimum-recognizable pixel size lay on their spatial resolution. Besides the limitation of\noptical imageries such as clouds, shadows caused by either meteorological conditions or\nelevation exposition, the use of optical remote sensing analysis and image classiﬁcation is\nvery indicative of very rapid to moderate mass movements such as ﬂow-like landslides,\nrock planar slides, debris slide, and rotational slides [12]. In recent years, several very high\nresolution (VHR) satellites have been launched and, due to their ﬁne spatial capacity to\nresolve pixels, more and more scientists have become familiar with object based image\nanalysis (OBIA) techniques applied to landslide recognition [ 13,14].

Most of the approaches used to\naddress mass movement recognition were change-detection algorithms [1,16] and pixel-\nbased supervised classiﬁcation [8]. Several studies highlighted the limits of pixel-by-pixel\nagainst OBIA methods [ 17,18] and some addressed the attention as well to the use of\nunsupervised classiﬁcation as a viable way to overcome landslide fragmentation detected\nby supervised analysis [19]. Another limitation of the classical supervised classiﬁcation\nrelies on the impossibility to directly remove spectral analogues classiﬁed pixels such as\nbare land, river beds, build-up areas and agriculture. A way to face such constraints is to\nuse in the post-classiﬁcation phase updated ancillary data, such as stream network [4] or\ndigital elevation model derivatives [20,21], to improve the method’s mapping accuracy.

Consequently, MODIS tracks a wider array of the earth’s vital signs than any\nother Terra sensor. For instance, the sensor measures the percent of the planet’s surface that is covered\nby clouds almost every day. This wide spatial coverage enables MODIS, together with MISR and CERES,\nto help scientists determine the impact of clouds and aerosols on the Earth’s energy budget.\n\nIn addition to recording the frequency and distribution of cloud cover, MODIS measures the properties\nof clouds such as the distribution and size of cloud droplets in both liquid water and ice clouds. MODIS\nalso measures the properties of aerosols—tiny liquid or solid particles in the atmosphere. Aerosols enter\nthe atmosphere from manmade sources like pollution and biomass burning and natural sources like dust\nstorms, volcanic eruptions, and forest fires."}

In turn, by coupling its sea surface temperature\nand ocean color measurements, MODIS has observed the impacts El Niño and La Niña have on the\nmicroscopic marine plant. MODIS also has a unique channel for measuring chlorophyll fluorescence. All\nplants bombarded with light begin to glow, or fluoresce, but in wavelengths that our eyes cannot see.\nThe more plants fluoresce, the less energy they are using for photosynthesis. Thus, MODIS not only\nmaps the distribution of phytoplankton, it also helps us gauge its health.\n\nAnother MODIS instrument flies aboard Terra’s sister ship—Aqua.\n\nMODIS web site (Goddard Space Flight Center)\n\nMODIS in the News\n\nNASA Official: Kurtis Thome  Webmaster: 610WebDev\nCurator: Nyssa Rayne  Last Updated: Sep 24, 2025\nPrivacy Policy & Important Notices   |   Accessibility   |   Contact UsNASA | Earth Observatory | Terra in\nVisible Earth\nNASATerra\n"}

The sensor measures\nemitted and reflected radiance from the Earth in three spectral bands. As this light enters the sensor, it\npasses along two different paths through onboard containers of carbon monoxide. The different paths\nabsorb different amounts of energy, leading to small differences in the resulting signals that correlate\nwith the presence of these gases in the atmosphere.\n\nMOPITT’s spatial resolution is 22 km at nadir and it ‘sees’ the Earth in swaths that are 640 km wide.\n"}
